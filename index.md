## About Me

My name is Josie and I am an ALIGN MSCS student expecting to graduate next year. I studied communication theory, English, and philosophy as an undergraduate student and I enjoy interdisciplinary research projects.

## About My Advisor

Christoph Riedl is an associate professor for Information Systems and Network Science at the Dâ€™Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University. He holds a joint appointment with the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and is a core faculty member at the Network Science Institute. His research interests are to understand how social and economic networks shape collaboration and decision-making on the individual, group, and community level. His research focuses on the future of work centered around human-AI collaboration, crowdsourcing, and collective intelligence.

## About My Project

The goal of our project is to create a natural language processing agent to analyze messages within a team of humans and generate interventions to improve the team's collective intelligence. A previous study by Christoph Riedl and Samuel Westby indicates that humans are not very effective at integrating or accurately weighing information provided by teammates, and that these shortcomings are predictive of team performance. The NLP agent uses communication between team members to ascertain the beliefs of the human team members, generating a theory-of-mind model. It uses this model to alert the human team members to information discrepancies and gaps in communication.
