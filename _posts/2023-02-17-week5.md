This week, I started setting up the website. We're using Heroku to deploy the site from Github. Since the NLP model is written in Python, I need to learn the best way to send data from Javascript to Python. There seem to be a few ways to do this, but I haven't tried any of them before. I have set up a Flask API and laid out the file structure. 

I've created a table showing the decision structure of the model based on ego- and alter-posteriors; e.g. if User A knows X and User B knows Y, the model suggests that User A communicate with User B. The next step is to populate a Decision Rule column that defines in mathematical terms the trigger for each intervention.
