title: Week 14

In order to ensure a smooth transition to the next researchers to work on this project, we have spent time this week cleaning and documenting our code. There are numerous files required for both the NLP model and the server and interface code, so we've done our best to describe each file and make notes about the architecture of the system. We have also begun preparing our respective reports on the project.

I turned up some interesting material on vulnerable communication in human-AI teaming while gathering sources. Apparently, good teamwork is not solely dependent on technical capabilities but also on the ability to foster vulnerable communication in casual and non-work interactions. Vulnerable communication promotes trust development within the team and serves as a significant predictor of team success, because healthy "trust calibration" is crucial in successful human-AI teams.

I've asked Professor Riedl if I can work on a project related to this for my thesis in the fall, focusing on communication paradigms within human-AI teams.
