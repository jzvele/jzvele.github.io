I consulted my web development professor about using separate front and back ends versus combining them, and after weighing the pros and cons, I think running everything on the server side rather than the client side makes more sense for this project. This means I'm doing more of the styling in Flask, which I have less experience with. This week I've been translating JavaScript to Python and debugging my resulting code. Flask has a jsonify function that does not handle arrays well, which took me a little while to fix, and error handling was also a challenge. I spent a considerable amount of time understanding Flask's error handling mechanisms and learned how to implement custom error handlers using the @app.errorhandler decorator.

Our NLP model is in its final form now, so the rest of the project will be design, integration, and intervention testing.
