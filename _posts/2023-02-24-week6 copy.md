The web design part of this project is the least challenging, but could also easily become the most time-consuming. I learned quite a lot about Bootstrap and Bootswatch this week, although probably spent too much time making miniscule changes. Currently working on box-error diagrams to share in the next meeting.

Things to consider re: decision rules: What happens if there are two possible interventions? How do we order them and figure out which is most useful? (K/L divergence? Choose the intervention that resolves the bigger divergence first? Should we come up with some hardcoded rule about only triggering one intervention every ten seconds or so?
