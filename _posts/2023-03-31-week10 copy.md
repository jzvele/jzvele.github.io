title: Week 10

Getting Tensorflow to run while the server is hosted on Heroku is proving to be extremely complicated, even though it is ostensibly as simple as using Docker to run PyTorch. I have followed several tutorials with no luck, so it looks like we're going to be developing this project in pieces and just hoping they all integrate when we deploy it in connection with the Volunteer Science platform. Overall, this week has been a lot of debugging on both sides.
