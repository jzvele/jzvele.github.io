title: Week 11

This week, we worked on getting the API, server, and model integrated. We have deployed a site that will take a message from a user, send it to the model for classification, and return the classification result to the site. I can't run the backend on my laptop for reasons we don't understand, but it works when run in Nidutt's environment, so this is probably an issue with my local setup rather than with the system itself. 

In my research this week, I learned about the phenomenon of "social loafing," which refers to a reduction in motivation and effort when individuals work collectively compared to when they work individually. Apparently this behavior is not limited to collaboration with humans, and participants in collaboration with AI assistants tend to perceive the AI as more capable than themselves and their human teammates. I think this is interesting in combination with the tendency for humans to distrust AI--these perceptions would seem to be in conflict.
