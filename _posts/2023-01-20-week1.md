We're starting with data consisting of messages sent between team-members working on a hidden profile problem. The team is tasked with figuring out the details of a heist: who the perpetrator was, when the crime took place, and where it took place. Each team member is given different information, and then they have to communicate via chat to figure out the solution.

The data was manually coded by another student, but some parameters of the project have changed since then, so we need to go through and change some of the codings. This data will be our ground truth--the data that the machine learning model will use to train itself. We will then build a very simple NLP model to use as a starting point from which to proceed.
