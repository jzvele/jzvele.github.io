This week on the intervention side, I set up a state management system for our server and updated my dummy interface code to reflect the changes. I'm thinking about how best to organize the data our model will receive and process. Currently I have users as arrays with some keywords representing their stances on the different dimensions, e.g. user2 is a Maybe Yes on Sharks as culprits. I think I will create a user class to hold this information more cogently. 

Tensorflow will not run correctly in my local environment, so I am using Colab as an environment for testing new Tensorflow code as I learn it. The textbook I'm using is AI and Machine Learning for Coders, which is a practical guide that does not require a deep understanding of the calculus or linear algebra underlying machine learning principles. This is helping me to better understand the architecture of our NLP model at a slightly more granular level.
